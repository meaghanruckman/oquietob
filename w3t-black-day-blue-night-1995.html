                            <p>Okay folks, this one has been a mystery over on the Imdb message boards for years now. I've tried my hand at it many times and came up empty. OP didn't want to post on reddit, but it gets a lot of traffic than there so I'm doing it for him. Just gonna copy/paste his description as it's quite lengthy. A movie from no later than 2002 at the very latest, most likely 90's, and surely no earlier than '85 or so. In all likelihood a low-budget TV movie. OP was living in Dubai Hey there everyone! I often see people asking where to start when getting into prog metal, so I thought instead of answering every one of them individually I'd make a list. I'm not going into too much depth because otherwise this will become endless, but I'll try to give a brief explanation of all styles I'm going over. So let's get started! #Part 0: Some information on the genre and motivation Since this guide got as huge as it did, I felt it was necessary to write a better introd.

So I decided to make a list with the replies to that post, some are TV movies and documentaries but the majority are indeed movies.

The lock was busted so they pushed past and headed down the narrow hallway, led by a foul stench.

This is as far as I’ve gotten transcribing playlists and converting to a written list. The beauty of Clutch, and one of the many reasons I love the band, is that they are actually like three different bands in one; as they have progressed and evolved over the 25 years of playing  Their debut album features the riff-filled droning screams commonly found in early Stoner Metal. But, it stands out lyrically and thematically. Their self-titled 2nd album is listed amongst the pantheon of Stoner.

Hi, my beloved truelesbians. Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films. A Lesbian Movie Database of sorts, or LMDB, if you will. :) I've listed the films alphabetically and included a link to the IMDB entry for each. I've tried to keep the blurbs spoiler-free. Some of these films have only marginal connections to lesbians, like _Mulholland Drive_, but I felt they should be included. In some cases, the characters could. Hey, guys. It's been a while but I'm back with more strange stories with my demon roommate, Hector. Lately I've been wondering if this is all a weird fever dream or if I've finally lost it from the stress of college debt, but I've decided to just let it all go and go with the flow. If you're curious as to what I'm talking about, you can brush up on my previous misadventures here (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/a01n6u/i_put_out_a_craigslist_ad_for_a_new_roommate_to/) and here (https.
