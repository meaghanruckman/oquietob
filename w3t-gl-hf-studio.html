Almost every Wednesday evening and Saturday afternoon for a while now, I‚Äôve been at the studios in Gangnam cheering for my favourite players and also Classic. Since I am familiar with the setup and layout of the GSL, I get messages JeffreyBardzell.

The last two years of Eurovision have both been pretty great.

About me and my stance on Lawbreakers: I did my best and played better and worse in the 77 hours I played now (PC, EU). I haven‚Äôt got many gripes with the game.

I would like to give the devs more feedback, I am just not very good at finding the problems, as what‚Äôs important to me is already very good.

"Political EDM" sounds like a contradiction, right? When I think of "political music" I think first of three things: the classic protest folk songs of the 1960s, political punk, and "conscious" hip hop. The next thing I think of is country, which frequently has a narrative structure and political themes, but, really, I don't think of EDM, even as a fan of electronic dance music. I get the feeling that this sub doesn't give a lot of credit to electronic dance music
